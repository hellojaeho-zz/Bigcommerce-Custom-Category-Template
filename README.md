# Bigcommerce Custom Category Template

Bigcommerce lacks a global variable to display children categories of the current category.  This repository will help you with that!

Along with the painting children categories, an optional filter that reads from the product title is available for use.
The filter can be customized using custom JSON file, which site maintainers can easily edit.

Paste the code from cat.js into either your main js file or in your category template file.
